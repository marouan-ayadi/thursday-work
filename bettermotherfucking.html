    		<h1>This is still a motherfucking website.</h1>
		</div>
		<div>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
			<h4>7 fucking declarations.</h4>
		</div>
		<div>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read </br> masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass</br> website:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Shit's still lightweight and loads fast</li>
			<li>Still fits on all your shitty screens</li>
			<li>Still looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
			<li>The motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
			<li>Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
		</ul>
		<div>
			<h2>And guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
		</div>
		<div>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Let it breathe</h2>

		Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not</br> married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum</br> line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see</br> that...piss off.</br>
	If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that?</br> Yes? What a shitty book.
		</div>

	<h2>A little less contrast</h2>

	<div>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a</br> bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so</br> focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</div>

	<h2>Size Matters</h2>
	<div>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to</br>16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.
	</div>
	<h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
	<div>I love what the creator of <a href="">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so</br> simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, </br>high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web</br> designers out there need to make them not total shit.</div>
